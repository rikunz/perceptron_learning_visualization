# Perceptron Model for Associative Learning

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Perceptron model for associative learning using Streamlit for the user interface. The Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network used for binary classifiers.

## Features

- **Setup Perceptron Model**: Configure the model with threshold and learning rate.
- **Add Training Data**: Input training data and target values.
- **Train the Model**: Train the Perceptron model step-by-step or continuously until convergence.
- **Predict**: Test the trained model with new input data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/perceptron-model.git
    cd perceptron-model
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```sh
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Follow the instructions on the web interface to set up the model, add training data, train the model, and make predictions.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the Streamlit application code.
- `perceptron.py`: Contains the implementation of the Perceptron model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

## Example

Here's a brief example of how to use the Perceptron model:

1. Set up the model with a threshold and learning rate.
2. Add training data with input values and target values.
3. Train the model until it converges.
4. Test the model with new input data to get predictions.
